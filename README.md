# scroll_vyper_grant


## Project summary

Vyper is a pythonic programming language for smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). We aim to become the most widely used smart contract programming language by offering superior developer experience, high quality tooling,  readability and maximum security.

## Team description

Vyper is an open source project with a core team of 5 highly experienced web3 engineers, over 20 contributors and many partners across the EVM toolchain, infrastructure and security ecosystems.
For this particular project the team will consist of 

- Charles is lead developer of Vyper (https://github.com/charles-cooper, https://x.com/big_tech_sux) and titanoboa (https://github.com/vyperlang/titanoboa). Charles also contributes to multiple Ethereum tooling projects (py-evm, pyrevm, eth-abi) and is the author of several EIPs.
- Harry (https://github.com/harkal, https://x.com/harkal) has been working on Vyper's intermediate representation (Venom) since 2023. Harry has over 10 years of experience in embedded programming and computer graphics.

## What makes your project unique compared to your competitors out there? What is novel about your approach?

Vyper stands out in the smart contract programming landscape due to its unique focus on readability, security, and simplicity. Unlike its main competitors such as Solidity, Fe, and Yul, is specifically designed to make contracts maximally human-readable, even to non-programmers. We also strive to keep the language easy to learn and simple to use. A big part of this is done by focusing on providing better tooling for developers. Many of the historical contributors to Vyper and its developer tool suite are also engineers for DeFi protocols, ensuring that both the language and tooling are optimized to the needs of developers.
This approach translates to several advantages:

- Easier and cheaper to audit: According to auditors, Vyper's simplicity reduces the time it takes to audit a protocol, resulting in roughly 20% cheaper auditing costs.
- Safer: Common security footguns such inline assembly, class inheritance or operator and function overloading are not available and prevent unforeseen vulnerabilities.
- Easy to onboard new developers: Vyper's pythonic syntax is familiar to the many developers already working with Python (currently the most widely used programming language) and has a low learning curve for beginner programmers.
- Optimized:  Simplicity in the code translates to more optimized contracts, which have, on average 50% smaller bytecode and less gas costs than Solidity contracts.

## How will your project benefit the broader Scroll ecosystem?*

We want to help the Scroll ecosystem grow by offering a better developer experience and easy onboarding to new builders. Larger Vyper adoption on Scroll also increases language diversity and therefore the resilience of its whole ecosystem.

With its pythonic, easy to learn syntax Vyper is uniquely positioned to attract new developers to Scroll, particularly those already familiar with Python. But Vyper's latest version and its convenient dev tool suite also appeal to established web3 developers, the majority of whom would prefer it to Solidity for their next project  (https://x.com/0xKoga/status/1805524364948893756). 

A big part of the increasing interest in Vyper among developers comes from more mature and accessible tooling. Tools like Titanoboa and the upcoming Gaboon enable faster testing, debugging, and deployment of smart contracts, as well as experimental and collaborative work through shared notebooks (https://try.vyperlang.org/).

We are committed to ensuring Scroll becomes a first-class citizen in the Vyper ecosystem. We want Vyper tooling to make deployment on Scroll easy and secure by better handling the chain's differences (opcodes, precompiled contracts) with Ethereum mainnet, making network management seamless and offering unmatched developer experience.
